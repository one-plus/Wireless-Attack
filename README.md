# Wireless-Attack
WiFi networks can be vulnerable to a variety of different attacks. Because of this, it’s important to be aware of them so you can take the necessary steps to prevent and reduce their impact.

So this week we’re going to look at what kind of attacks you should be aware of.

You can find out a lot more in-depth information on these attacks in the CWNA Official Study Guide 4th Edition.

Rogue Wireless Devices:

A rogue wireless device, or access point, is an unauthorised WiFi device added onto the network that isn’t under the management of the network admins. They allow potential attackers a gateway into the network.
This sort of device can be maliciously installed if the attacker has direct access to the wired network, but more often than not they are added by staff that are not aware of the implications.

Peer-to-peer Attacks:
Devices that are connected to the same access points can be vulnerable to attacks from other devices connected to that access point.

Most providers provide for an option such as “Client Isolation” which ensures that clients connected to the access point cannot communicate with eachother, preventing this issue.

Eavesdropping:
This is where wireless communications are monitored. There are two types of of eavesdropping.

The first, casual eavesdropping, or sometimes called WLAN discovery, is where a wireless client actively scans for wireless access points.

The second type, malicious eavesdropping, is the illegal kind. This is where someone tries to listen in on the data transferred between clients and the access point. Because of this, it is essential to encrypt your networks, as anything unencrypted can be listened in on.

Encryption Cracking:
This is where the attacker attempts to crack the encryption on the network. WEP networks are the most susceptible to this, being that they can be easily cracked in as little as 5minutes.

It is important to ensure that you use the most secure encryption you can, and avoid using WEP where possible.

Authentication Attacks:
This is where the attacker scrapes a frame exchange between a client authenticating with the network, and then they simply run an offline dictionary attack.

With this sort of information, and depending on the strength of the password, it could be just a matter of time before they crack the password and gain access. Because of this it’s important to keep your login credentials as secure as possible.

MAC Spoofing:
MAC spoofing is an extremely easy thing to do. Because of this, using MAC filtering to control which devices can connect to your network is not secure at all.

It can however be used in conjunction with other security measures to build up an overall more secure network architecture.

Management Interface Exploits:
This sort of attack can become an issue when you make use of some devices such as wireless controllers that allow you to control your access points via things like web interfaces or console access.

Default login credentials are widely available on the internet, so it’s crucial to ensure that all devices are securely locked down to prevent unauthorised access.

Wireless Hijacking:
This occurs in situations where the attacker configures their laptop to broadcast as a wireless access point, using the same SSID as a public hotspot.

They then sit back and unsuspecting victims end up connecting to it, thinking it is the genuine public hotspot. This leaves them open to peer-to-peer attacks as well as monitor the victim’s actions on the network.

Denial of Service:
This term covers a number of different things. DoS attacks can occur on different layers.

Layer 1 attacks are known as RF jamming attacks, and can be both intentional (attacker generating a signal to deliberately cause interference) and unintentional (devices such as microwaves or wireless phones causing interference.

Layer 2 attacks can occur in a number of different ways. For example, an attacker can flood an AP with spoofed association and disassociation requests.

There are solutions out there that are used to detect these sort of attacks, and allow you to take steps in stopping them.

Social Engineering:
Contrary to popular belief, most successful hacks are not achieved through scripts, software or tools. Most occur due to social engineering.

This is a technique used to manipulate people into giving out information, such as computer passwords, or information that will help attackers narrow down potential passwords. The best way to deal with this potential threat is to ensure that people are educated on security procedures such as changing passwords regularly, and not sharing private information.
