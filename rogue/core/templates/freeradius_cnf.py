# MODULE CONFIGURATION
#
#  The names and configuration of each module is located in this section.
#
#  After the modules are defined here, they may be referred to by name,
#  in other sections of this configuration file.
#
modules {
	#
	#  Each module has a configuration as follows:
	#
	#	name [ instance ] {
	#		config_item = value
	#		...
	#	}
	#
	#  The 'name' is used to load the 'rlm_name' library
	#  which implements the functionality of the module.
	#
	#  The 'instance' is optional.  To have two different instances
	#  of a module, it first must be referred to by 'name'.
	#  The different copies of the module are then created by
	#  inventing two 'instance' names, e.g. 'instance1' and 'instance2'
	#
	#  The instance names can then be used in later configuration
	#  INSTEAD of the original 'name'.  See the 'radutmp' configuration
	#  for an example.
	#

	#
	#  As of 3.0, modules are in mods-enabled/.  Files matching
	#  the regex /[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+/ are loaded.  The modules are
	#  initialized ONLY if they are referenced in a processing
	#  section, such as authorize, authenticate, accounting,
	#  pre/post-proxy, etc.
	#
	$INCLUDE mods-enabled/
}

# Instantiation
#
#  This section orders the loading of the modules.  Modules
#  listed here will get loaded BEFORE the later sections like
#  authorize, authenticate, etc. get examined.
#
#  This section is not strictly needed.  When a section like
#  authorize refers to a module, it's automatically loaded and
#  initialized.  However, some modules may not be listed in any
#  of the following sections, so they can be listed here.
#
#  Also, listing modules here ensures that you have control over
#  the order in which they are initialized.  If one module needs
#  something defined by another module, you can list them in order
#  here, and ensure that the configuration will be OK.
#
#  After the modules listed here have been loaded, all of the modules
#  in the "mods-enabled" directory will be loaded.  Loading the
#  "mods-enabled" directory means that unlike Version 2, you usually
#  don't need to list modules here.
#
instantiate {
	#
	# We list the counter module here so that it registers
	# the check_name attribute before any module which sets
	# it
#	daily

	# subsections here can be thought of as "virtual" modules.
	#
	# e.g. If you have two redundant SQL servers, and you want to
	# use them in the authorize and accounting sections, you could
	# place a "redundant" block in each section, containing the
	# exact same text.  Or, you could uncomment the following
	# lines, and list "redundant_sql" in the authorize and
	# accounting sections.
	#
	#  The "virtual" module defined here can also be used with
	#  dynamic expansions, under a few conditions:
	#
	#  * The section is "redundant", or "load-balance", or
	#    "redundant-load-balance"
	#  * The section contains modules ONLY, and no sub-sections
	#  * all modules in the section are using the same rlm_
	#    driver, e.g. They are all sql, or all ldap, etc.
	#
	#  When those conditions are satisfied, the server will
	#  automatically register a dynamic expansion, using the
	#  name of the "virtual" module.  In the example below,
	#  it will be "redundant_sql".  You can then use this expansion
	#  just like any other:
	#
	#
	#  In this example, the expansion is done via module "sql1",
	#  and if that expansion fails, using module "sql2".
	#
	#  For best results, configure the "pool" subsection of the
	#  module so that "retry_delay" is non-zero.  That will allow
	#  the redundant block to quickly ignore all "down" SQL
	#  databases.  If instead we have "retry_delay = 0", then
	#  every time the redundant block is used, the server will try
	#  to open a connection to every "down" database, causing
	#  problems.

	#	sql1
