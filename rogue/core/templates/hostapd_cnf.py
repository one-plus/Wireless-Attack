# NAS-Identifier string for RADIUS messages. When used, this should be unique
# to the NAS within the scope of the RADIUS server. Please note that hostapd
# uses a separate RADIUS client for each BSS and as such, a unique
# nas_identifier value should be configured separately for each BSS. This is
# particularly important for cases where RADIUS accounting is used
# (Accounting-On/Off messages are interpreted as clearing all ongoing sessions
# and that may get interpreted as applying to all BSSes if the same
# NAS-Identifier value is used.) For example, a fully qualified domain name
# prefixed with a unique identifier of the BSS (e.g., BSSID) can be used here.
#
# When using IEEE 802.11r, nas_identifier must be set and must be between 1 and
# 48 octets long.
#
# It is mandatory to configure either own_ip_addr or nas_identifier to be

# strongly recommended that nas_identifier is set to a unique value for each
# BSS.

# 2 = required; reject authentication if RADIUS server does not include VLAN ID

# Per-Station AP_VLAN interface mode
# If enabled, each station is assigned its own AP_VLAN interface.
# This implies per-station group keying and ebtables filtering of inter-STA
# traffic (when passed through the AP).

# added to the bridge given by the "bridge" configuration option (see above).
# Otherwise, it will be added to the per-VLAN bridge.

# VLAN interface list for dynamic VLAN mode is read from a separate text file.
# This list is used to map VLAN ID from the RADIUS server to a network
# interface. Each station is bound to one interface in the same way as with
# multiple BSSIDs or SSIDs. Each line in this text file is defining a new
# interface and the line must include VLAN ID and interface name separated by

# Arbitrary RADIUS attributes can be added into Access-Request and

# add multiple attributes. These parameters can also be used to override some
# of the attributes added automatically by hostapd.
# Format: <attr_id>[:<syntax:value>]
# attr_id: RADIUS attribute type (e.g., 26 = Vendor-Specific)
# syntax: s = string (UTF-8), d = integer, x = octet string

# If syntax and value parts are omitted, a null value (single 0x00 octet) is
